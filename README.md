# **Tutorial Management System**

# **Project Context**

A client has requested a demo of a tutorial management system. In the future, this system will allow users to upload and view tutorials similar to Udemy, as well as edit or delete them.

# **Project Description**

The goal of this project is to develop a tutorial management system using Java and MySQL that allows users to:
- View a list of tutorials
- Add tutorials to the database
- Delete tutorials from the database
- Edit an existing tutorial
To achieve this, we have used the MVC design pattern, implemented a complete CRUD and performed unit tests for each functionality of the CRUD.

## Used technology

- **Java**
- **Spring Boot**
- **MySQL**
- **JUnit**

## Principles and Good Practices

We have followed object-oriented programming principles and SOLID best practices to ensure that our code is robust, maintainable and extensible.

## Project Structure

The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to separate responsibilities and improve code organization.

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic. Uses JPA entities to interact with the MySQL database.
- **View**: In this project, a specific view layer has not been implemented since it is a backend. However, data is exposed through REST endpoints.
- **Controller**: Manages HTTP requests and coordinates responses using services.

## Features

1. **See List of Tutorials**
 - Endpoint: `GET /tutorials`
 - Description: Allows you to view all the tutorials available in the database.

2. **Add Tutorial**
 - Endpoint: `POST /tutorials`
 - Description: Allows you to add a new tutorial to the database.
 - Body: `{ "title": "titulo", "description": "descripcion", "published": true/false }`

3. **Delete Tutorial**
 - Endpoint: `DELETE /tutorials/{id}`
 - Description: Allows you to delete an existing tutorial from the database.

4. **Edit Tutorial**
 - Endpoint: `PUT /tutorials/{id}`
 - Description: Allows you to update an existing tutorial.
 - Body: `{ "title": "new title", "description": "new description", "published": true/false }`

## Evidence

Unit tests have been carried out for each of the CRUD functionalities using JUnit.

## Installation and Execution

### Previous requirements

- Java 11 or higher
